                            Kubernetes is a container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.<br>
                            It was originally designed by Google and is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation.<br>
                            The name Kubernetes originates from Greek, meaning helmsman or pilot. Google open-sourced the Kubernetes project in 2014.<br>
                            Kubernetes is a portable, extensible, open-source platform for managing containerized workloads and services, that facilitates both declarative configuration and automation.<br>
