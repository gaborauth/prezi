                            Who uses Kubernetes? Hands up!<br>
                            So, in nutshell only.<br>
                            So, Kubernetes is a container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized
                            applications.<br>
                            The name Kubernetes originates from Greek, meaning helmsman or ship pilot.<br>
                            It was originally designed by Google and is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation. Google open-sourced the
                            Kubernetes project ten year ago.<br>
                            The configuration is declarative, so you can define what you want, instead of how you want it.<br>

                            Service discovery and orchestration: Kubernetes can track your services real-time and automatically create or update the network for
                            them.<br>
                            Automated rollout and rollback: Kubernetes can change the state of your application.<br>
                            Configuration management: Kubernetes can store and manage the whole configuration of your application.<br>
                            Health checks and rules: Kubernetes can check the health of your application and restart it if it's necessary.<br>
                            Load balancing: Kubernetes provides load balancers and proxies for your application.<br>
                            Self-healing: Kubernetes can heal itself if something goes wrong. It's really unstoppable.<br>

                            The system will be consistent across all environments, because the configuration mainly is the same, you can store the differences

                            Kustomize has two main parts, the base and the overlays.<br>
                            The base contains the main and common configuration of the application.<br>
                            The overlays contain only the differences between the environments.<br>
